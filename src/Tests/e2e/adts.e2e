// Sum type (ADT) tests with payloads for Phase 7 Milestone 4

// None case returns tag 0
type Option = None | Some of int None = stdout="0\n"

// Err case returns tag 1 (second variant)
type Result = Ok of int | Err Err = stdout="1\n"

// Variant ordering with payloads
type Three = A | B of int | C A = stdout="0\n"

type Three = A | B of int | C C = stdout="2\n"

// Multiple payload types in let binding (just verify it compiles)
type Option = None | Some of int let n = None in n = stdout="0\n"
