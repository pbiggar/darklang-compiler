// Sum type (ADT) tests with payloads for Phase 7 Milestone 4

// None case - verify through pattern matching

// Err case - verify through pattern matching
type Result = Ok of Int64 | Err match Err with | Err -> 1 | Ok(x) -> 0 = stdout="1\n"

// Variant ordering - A is first variant
type Three = A | B of Int64 | C match A with | A -> 0 | B(x) -> 1 | C -> 2 = stdout="0\n"

// C is third variant
type Three = A | B of Int64 | C match C with | A -> 0 | B(x) -> 1 | C -> 2 = stdout="2\n"

// Multiple payload types in let binding
type Option = None | Some of Int64 let n = None in match n with | None -> 0 | Some(x) -> x = stdout="0\n"

// Verify Some(42) returns payload
type Option = None | Some of Int64 match Some(42) with | None -> 0 | Some(x) -> x = stdout="42\n"

// Verify Ok(100) returns payload
