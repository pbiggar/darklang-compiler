// Enum (simple sum type) tests for Phase 7 Milestone 3

// Basic enum type - first variant (tag 0)
type Color = Red | Green | Blue Red = stdout="0\n"

// Second variant (tag 1)
type Color = Red | Green | Blue Green = stdout="1\n"

// Third variant (tag 2)
type Color = Red | Green | Blue Blue = stdout="2\n"

// Enum with two variants
type Bool2 = False2 | True2 False2 = stdout="0\n"

type Bool2 = False2 | True2 True2 = stdout="1\n"

// Single variant enum
type Unit2 = Unit2 Unit2 = stdout="0\n"

// Enum in let binding
type Color = Red | Green | Blue let c = Red in c = stdout="0\n"

type Color = Red | Green | Blue let c = Blue in c = stdout="2\n"

// Multiple enums in nested let
type Color = Red | Green | Blue let a = Red in let b = Green in let c = Blue in c = stdout="2\n"

// Enum with four variants
type Direction = North | East | South | West North = stdout="0\n"

type Direction = North | East | South | West South = stdout="2\n"

type Direction = North | East | South | West West = stdout="3\n"
