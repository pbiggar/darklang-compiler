// ===================================================================
// Basic Let Bindings
// ===================================================================

// Simple let binding

(let x = 10 in let y = 5 in x - y) * 2 = 10


// ===================================================================
// Complex Expressions
// ===================================================================

// Let binding with complex value expression
let x = 2 + 3 in x = 5
